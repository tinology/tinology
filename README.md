## Hi I'm Justin, a self taught software engineer who loves solving problems with code.

I have not received a traditional college/university education in computer science. So have attempted to create my own education from various syllabuses from respected undergraduate programs.

### Current Reading Material
- [] Computer Networking Top Down Approach - Chapters 2 & 3
- [] Designing Data Intensive Applications
- [] Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective
- [] Programming in Haskell
